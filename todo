# TODO

- varargs that get put in a nested generated function aren't valid anymore:

- cascading expressions in function call? this looks too much like line decorator
* maybe with assigns only

	my_func if something
	  "one arg"
	else
	  "other arg"


- class expressions, x = class extends Hello do new: => print "hello"

* multiline comments
* table slices (almost)
* add continue keyword (ouch)
* vim syntax file

* combine for and if line decorators

* elseif with value that inserts lines
  - need to decompose elif into if inside else

* export could also be used like so:

	export a = -> "hello"

or

	x = 232
	export x


* allow return anywhere in block
* upercase constants and capital letter variables should automatically be exported (in the global scope?)

* any/every keywords for comprehensions? (what about iterators)

not working right:

    double_args = (...) ->
      [x * 2 for x in *{...}]


still some issues with whitespace at end of line

* let array items in table be defined without {} when indented
* key,value table comprehensions with { }
