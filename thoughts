-- local * and local ^

-- seems like running in moon messes up require order

- don't reuse _, put a local on it, so we don't keep around trash

-- swithc X with Func

- or= and=

- error with stray comma at end of line

* multiline comments
* table slices (almost)

* combine for and if line decorators

* export later? nah

	x = 232
	export x


* allow return anywhere in block

* any/every keywords for comprehensions? (what about iterators)

* let array items in table be defined without {} when indented (no, too similar to arguments)

-- for searching? for returning to accumulator early?
x = for thing in *things
	if is_important thing
		break thing 

-- all function literals have a string that is their function definition
